Sick_Yaki is a popular Instagram account (1M+ followers) created by Korean artist “wookiema.” It stars two cartoon characters – Sickyaki (a small yellow chick) and Pingdori (a round gray penguin) – drawn in a playful, kawaii style. The artist even describes Sickyaki as “a sickly chick” in her bio. The Casetify artist profile notes that Wookiema “brings her friendly characters Sickyaki and Pingdori to life through whimsical illustrations,” with an aim to celebrate imperfection and joy

. In other words, the Instagram feed is filled with cute, colorful drawings (often pastel-yellow and gray) of this quirky chick and penguin, usually rendered as soft blobs with simple eyes and blushy cheeks.

The posts typically show Yaki and Dori in everyday slice-of-life scenes. For example, one popular reel (June 2023) shows the gray Pingdori gently massaging Yaki’s back to comfort her

. Wookiema’s own description of Sickyaki explains her personality: “a small, weak chick that is crinkly… [who] doesn’t even have the energy to take [problems] seriously,” living in a “desolate city” and “adapting in [her] own way.” A distinctive feature is Yaki’s “peach butt” – literally a peach-shaped bottom – which the artist notes is the chick’s “point of attraction”

. In most illustrations Yaki is shy or sleepy, while Pingdori (whose name hints at a penguin) is often shown caring for her or just hanging out together. Many captions and hashtags (in Korean and English) reinforce their bond, using tags like #sickyaki #pingdori #병약이 #핑도리 and #일상툰 (“daily cartoon”) to indicate the focus on their friendship and couple-like moments.

Beyond single images, Sick_Yaki often posts short animated reels or “instatoon” clips. These use simple, smooth motion to show the characters walking, hugging, or reacting in sync, usually with gentle music. The tone throughout is warm and humorous – the duo might be shown napping together, playing guitar (as in one April 2024 post), or dealing with mundane tech (e.g. an Apple AirTag). The brand’s message is about friendship, self-care and embracing one’s flaws. As Casetify’s feature notes put it, Wookiema’s designs “celebrate imperfect yet unconditional companionship” and aim to inspire joy and freedom in living as our own imperfect selves

. In short, the style is gentle and cute (almost “goma-eun-bu” adorable), often with a hint of sweet melancholy or encouragement (e.g. a reel captioned “Massage time” with the tags #selfcare and #공감툰). The target audience seems to be fans of kawaii characters and relatable comics – likely teens and young adults who enjoy wholesome couple/friendship stories and digital stickers.

Sick_Yaki has evolved into a full-fledged brand with merchandise and projects. For instance, Casetify sells phone cases featuring Yaki and Dori patterns – one clear case design titled “yakidori mix” is filled with little yellow chicks and gray penguins with hearts and snacks (see below). Casetify’s write-up highlights that their “Sickyaki characters” are reimagined as “eye-catching yet meaningfully cute designs for tech products” to spread joy

. The creator also offers a paid sticker app (“Sick Yaki Stickers” on iOS/Android) that lets users send hundreds of custom Sick_Yaki stickers in chat – the app description touts “vibrant, edgy, and unique stickers that capture Sick Yaki’s bold style”

. There are T-shirts (on TeePublic) featuring motifs like “peach butt Sickyaki” or “Yaki & Dori” together, and the characters appear in KakaoTalk and LINE messaging sticker packs (e.g. “쭈글쭈글 병아리, 병약이” sets). The artist even ran a (though ultimately unsuccessful) campaign to create a plush doll of Sickyaki. Outside of merchandise, Wookiema has published an iPad drawing book and offers online classes on character art, leveraging her Sick_Yaki characters as examples.

In sum, Instagram @sick_yaki is a cute-comics account featuring a sickly chick (Yaki) and her penguin friend (Dori) in daily scenes. Its visual style is simple, colorful cartooning. The tone is sweet, relatable, and light-hearted – often described as a blend of friendship, self-care and gentle humor. The pair’s story isn’t a serial plot but a thematic one: Yaki and Dori embody “imperfect yet unconditional companionship,” showing love and support for one another in comic vignettes
